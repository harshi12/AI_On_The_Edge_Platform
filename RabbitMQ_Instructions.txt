Step1: pip3 install pika

Step2: Import queue_req_resp in your code

Step3: Create a rabbitmq object and use it to call functions defined in queue_req_resp.py file

Have a receive function with the following definition:
  receive(self, callback, exchange, routing_key)
  callback is the function defining what you want to do with the data received
  routing_key is the name of queue from which you will read data
  Keep exchange as empty string for now -> exchange = ""
   Service Manager to VM/Docker Manager: SM_Docker
   VM/Docker Manager to Service Manager : Docker_SM
   Service Manager to Scheduler: SM_Scheduler
   Scheduler to Service Manager: Scheduler_SM
   Application Developer to Service Manager: AD_SM
  
  Receive function is a blocking call. Use threading if required
  
On demand request-reponse queues can be created using function create_ServiceQueues() function
On demand request queue can be created using function create_queue()

Instructions for Send Function:
  send(exchange_name, queue_name, message)
  keep exchange_name blank -> ""
  queue_name is the queue declared between the modules
  message is the message that supposed to be sent
