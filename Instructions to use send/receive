Import queue_req_resp in your code

Create a rabbitmq object as first step and use it to call receive and send functions

Have a receive function with the following definition:
  receive(self, callback, exchange, routing_key)
  callback is the function defining what you want to do with the data received
  routing_key is the name of queue from which you will read data
  Keep exchange as empty string for now -> exchange = ""
  Between Service Manager and VM/Docker Manager: SM_Docker
  Between Service Manager and Scheduler: SM_Schedule
  Between Service Manager and Application Developer: AD_Input
  
Receive function is a blocking call. Use threading if required
